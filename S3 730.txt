S3 : Simple Storage Service : 
-
Object based storage :  We cannot install/run any applications/os. : Dropbox / GDrive 
--> Designed to flat files.

Block based storage : Designed to run OS, We can install/run applications.. : EBS, Instance store volumes. : EC2 
Storage over the network : Storage runs over the network and it can be mounted to multiple devices. : EFS, FSx : EC2

--> Designed to store objects. We can store any flat files.
--> We store data in BUCKETS. 
--> Bucket names should be unique across the globe. 
--> Defualtly, we can create 100 buckets, This is a soft limit. 
--> We can store unlimited data in a bucket.
--> No Pre-provisioning required.
--> Bucket naming limitations
	--> Min char 3, Max 63 char length
	--> Bucket name should be in small , and numeric
	--> Bucket name should not start with .
	--> Should not end with . , No adjesent ..
	--> Bucket name should not resemble IP address format. (192.168.100.1)

--> We can upload objects to this buckets.
--> Min obj size : 0 bytes.. Max Obj size: 5 TB
--> S3 is a global service. Doesn't required region selection.
--> While creating we need to choose the region. Data physically resides at this regions AZs. 

https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)

Virtual paths won't work if we have . in bucket names.

Block Public Access settings for this account : Account Level Blocking
Block public access (bucket settings) : Bucket level Blocking
--> We should make an object public, then only Object URLs works.

S3 Free Tier ELigibility : 
5 GB Standard Storage
--> 2000 PUT / 20,000 GET

--> Where to monitor free tier limitation.?
Billing Dashboard --> Cost Management Preferences --> Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts.

--> How to get alert whe you are exceeding free tier/ if any service is costing us..?

S3 Storage Classes : 

--> S3 Standard : Defualt storage class for all the data we upload to s3. Data will be available immedeatly.
Designed to store : Frequently accessed data. 
Availability : 99.99%,  Durability: 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> Standard-IA : Data will be available immedeatly. Designed to store : infrequently accessed data
Avai : 99.9%, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> One Zone-IA : Data will be available immedeatly. Designed to store : infrequently accessed data. Store only non-critical data
Avai : 99.5 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : 1 AZs

--> Glacier : Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours. Data won't be available immedeatly. We need to initiate a data restration to view the data. Restoration takes (1 min - 5 Hrs)
Avai : 99.99 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> Glacier Deep Archieve : Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from 12 hrs. Data won't be available immedeatly. We need to initiate a data restration to view the data. Restoration takes (5 - 12 Hrs)
Avai : 99.99 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs
..
S3 Intelligent Tier : If we have unknown access pattern, we can choose. 
Avai : 99.9 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

RRS : Redused Redundancy Storage : Not Recommanded : Less durability.. 
Durability : 99.99%, As we have less durability we have high chances to loss the data when compared to another storage classes.


S3 Pricing : 
--> How much data we are storing.
--> How many GET/PUT operations (uploads/downloaded object count)
--> Data retrivals

Glacier data retrival : 
Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.

_________

Version : AWS maintains multiple copies in s3 bucket. 
--> Defaultly versioning will be in Suspended state.
--> When versioning is enabled, If we delete an object

Versioning : HIDE
--> S3 will show most recent uploaded object only.
--> We will get a Delete Marker. 
--> TO get object back / undo delete, Set Version to SHOW, Delete the delete marker.

Versioning : SHOW
--> If we delete an object, it deletes permanently.

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Life Cycle Management Rule : 

S3 Standard --> StandardIA --> Glacier --> Delete
S3 Standard --> Glacier --> Delete
S3 Standard --> Delete


CRR / SRR : 
--> Source bucket and destination bucket must be enabled with versioning. 
--> Existing objects will not replicate to the destination bucket.
--> All future / subsequent uploads will replicate to destination bucket. 

RTC : Replication time control : Data replicates to destination bucket with in 15 Min. (99.99% of the data) : COST US

___
Data transfer from One region to another region cost us.
Data transfer within a region won't cost us anything.

GDrive : 100 gb  / 1 TB plan / 200 gb

Access Pattern : 

20 gb daily basis			--> S3 Standard
20 gb infreq				--> Standard-IA / OneZone-IA
20 gb long term archieve purpose 	--> Glacier / DA
20 gb non mission critical data.. 	--> RRS
