S3 : Simple Storage Service : 
-
Object based storage :  We cannot install/run any applications/os. : Dropbox / GDrive 
--> Designed to flat files.

Block based storage : Designed to run OS, We can install/run applications.. : EBS, Instance store volumes. : EC2 
Storage over the network : Storage runs over the network and it can be mounted to multiple devices. : EFS, FSx : EC2

--> Designed to store objects. We can store any flat files.
--> We store data in BUCKETS. 
--> Bucket names should be unique across the globe. 
--> Defualtly, we can create 100 buckets, This is a soft limit. 
--> We can store unlimited data in a bucket.
--> No Pre-provisioning required.
--> Bucket naming limitations
	--> Min char 3, Max 63 char length
	--> Bucket name should be in small , and numeric
	--> Bucket name should not start with .
	--> Should not end with . , No adjesent ..
	--> Bucket name should not resemble IP address format. (192.168.100.1)

--> We can upload objects to this buckets.
--> Min obj size : 0 bytes.. Max Obj size: 5 TB
--> S3 is a global service. Doesn't required region selection.
--> While creating we need to choose the region. Data physically resides at this regions AZs. 

https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)

Virtual paths won't work if we have . in bucket names.

Block Public Access settings for this account : Account Level Blocking
Block public access (bucket settings) : Bucket level Blocking
--> We should make an object public, then only Object URLs works.

S3 Free Tier ELigibility : 
5 GB Standard Storage
--> 2000 PUT / 20,000 GET

--> Where to monitor free tier limitation.?

Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

RRS : Redused Redundancy Storage : Not Recommanded : Less durability.. 
Durability : 99.99%, As we have less durability we have high chances to loss the data when compared to another storage classes.


S3 Pricing : 
--> How much data we are storing.
--> How many GET/PUT operations (uploads/downloaded object count)
--> Data retrivals

Glacier Flexible data retrival : 
Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.

_________

Version : AWS maintains multiple copies in s3 bucket. 
--> Defaultly versioning will be in Suspended state.
--> When versioning is enabled, If we delete an object

Versioning : HIDE
--> S3 will show most recent uploaded object only.
--> We will get a Delete Marker. 
--> TO get object back / undo delete, Set Version to SHOW, Delete the delete marker.

Versioning : SHOW
--> If we delete an object, it deletes permanently.

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Life Cycle Management Rule : 
--> We can apply Rule to entire bucket
--> We can limit rule to a prefix (Folder)
--> We can limit rule to objects by specifing a "Tag"


S3 Standard --> StandardIA --> Glacier --> Delete
S3 Standard --> Glacier --> Delete
S3 Standard --> Delete


CRR / SRR : 
--> Source bucket and destination bucket must be enabled with versioning. 
--> Existing objects will not replicate to the destination bucket.
--> All future / subsequent uploads will replicate to destination bucket. 

RTC : Replication time control : Data replicates to destination bucket with in 15 Min. (99.99% of the data) : COST US

___
Data transfer from One region to another region cost us.
Data transfer within a region won't cost us anything.
_______________________
Task : Create an S3 bucket, Upload some data, Enable versioning.. Upload same data again multiple times.. 

Configure Life cycle management rule to Transit objects from S3 standard to Delete after 3 Days.. Previous versions should delete after 2 days.

--> In-Transit Encryption : 
	SSL (Secure socket layer) / TLS (Transport layer secure)

--> SSE (Server Side Encryption) / At-rest : 

SSE-S3 : S3 platform generates and manages the key material. whoever have valid access on S3 platform can decrypt/view the data. (An encryption key that Amazon S3 creates, manages, and uses for you).

SSE-KMS : Key Management Service : 
	KMS (AWS managed keys) (aws/s3) DMK(Default Master Key) : KMS Service generates and manages the key material. whoever have valid access on S3 platform can decrypt/view the data. We cannot delete these keys. 
	 CMK (Customer managed keys) : KMS Service generates and manages the keymaterial.
Along with S3 platform, the IAM user need to have valid permissions on ENCRYPTION KEY also. NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY.
	SSE-C (Customer Provided Key): Customer generates and upload the key material to KMS and KMS uses this key material to encrypt/decrypt the data. CUstomer can change the key material at any time. NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY.

CSE (Client Side Encryption) : Before uploading data to s3 platform, we can use our own software/applications to encrypt the data. That encryptrd data we can send to s3. AWS is not completely responsible for this mechanism.

Requester pays : the requester pays for requests and data transfer costs, and anonymous access to this bucket is disabled. Instead of bucket owner data requester need to pay for the data transfer & request.
--> Anonomus access disables once we enable this feature.

Transfer acceleration : Uses Edge locations for data transfer. (COST US)
S3 Transfer Acceleration is not supported for buckets with periods (.) in their names

Object Lock : 
--> Versioning must be enabled.
Permanently allows objects in this bucket to be locked. Additional Object Lock configuration is required in bucket details after bucket creation to protect objects in this bucket from being deleted or overwritten.

Governance : Users with specific IAM permissions can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

Compliance : No users can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

S3 Static Website hosting : Fixed website/webpages.
--> DOmain name should be same as Bucket Name. (Route53)
--> Data should be made Public Read. 

We can access webiste using bucket website endpoint

Storage Class Analysis : Analyze storage access patterns to help you decide when to transition objects to the appropriate storage class. 

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
The CORS configuration, written in JSON, defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.

Performance : 

--> Increase the randomness in object names.
--> Use the prefixes. 

--> 3500 PUT/Sec.. 5500 GET/Sec.. If we are directly storing all data in s3 platform.

In S3, Perfix place imp role. /prefix we will get 3500 put & 5500 get operations.

Req: 35,000 PUT.. --> Create 10 folders and upload data simumtaniously. 

__________________

FOr Put of new object, "read after write consistency". (If upload sucess, we can start accessing the data without any delay)
Eventual consistenacy For overwrite an object / delete an object. (AFter delete shown as success, we may get response for the request for some milli seconds) (You have uploaded object with latest data and trying to access, you have chances to get previous data object)
