AWS Managed POlicy - Job FUnction : Based on standard industry job, AWS provided these polocies. We cannot delete these policies.

AWS Managed POlicy : Based on aws services, we will get these polocies. We cannot delete these policies.

CUstomer Managed Policy : We can create polocies, based on our requirement. 


Scenario 1 : Need an IAM user with Only S3 full Access.!!

Scenario 2 :Need an IAM user with Full access on AWS Environment, But not on "S3". 
		(Except s3, need to provide all services access)

Create an IAM user with "AdministratorAccess" and "Deny S3" Policy.

--> Deny will always have highest priority.  You allowed 100 times, but denied only one time : DENY will take effect..!!


Service : S3 / ec2	: S3

Actions : Allow / Deny	: Deny
			: All Actions	(List/Read/Write)

Resources : Apply to all resources. 	(Limit bucket / Server)


An IAM user, need to work only in one specific region, THen we can add below condition. 

           "Condition": {
                "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestedRegion": "ap-south-1"
___

   "Condition": {
	 "NotIpAddress": {"aws:SourceIp": "124.123.184.186/32"}

Policy simulator : The simulator evaluates the policies that you choose and determines the effective permissions for each of the actions that you specify.


arn : Amazon Resource Name : arn:aws:iam::501170960000:user/UserName

Password Policy : A password policy is a set of rules that define the type of password an IAM user can set.

________________________________________


Task 1 : Create an IAM user, Provide him "AdministratorAccess". Try to access Billing console.!!! Yes/No.??
How we can provide billing console access to the User.!!

Task 2 : Create an IAM user, Who can access EC2 Resources only from "Mumbai Region".

Task 3 : Create an IAM user, Create policy to "Deny * in S3 and EC2", Allocate to the IAM user.. Login as IAM User and Test his access on S3/ec2/iam.
Use Policy SImulator to Simulate his permissions to "Create S3 Bucket".
