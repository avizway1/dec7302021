GoldenAMI on Linux : 

How to recover a Linux instance, if we lost Keyapir..!!!
Ans : Choose the Instance --> Create a GAMI --> Launch from GAMI with New Keypair.


Task 1 : Launch linux ec2 instance with 8gb root volume. Add additional "1 gb" volume to ec2 instance and make it available at OS level. (reboot and test it)

Task 2 : Increase the size of the "1 gb" volume to "2 gb" we used in task 1, make it available. 

Task 3 : Install webserver is Linux instance, Create a golden AMI of the linux instance. 
While launching instance from goldenAMi, In final step, choose a new keypair. try to login to instance with both the keypairs. 
(If both key pairs are working, Where the keypair entry existed)

Task 4 : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-users.html

Task 5 : Launch Windows ec2 instance, CREATE CUSTOM PASSWORD FOR ADMINISTRAOR, Make it as webserver by installing "IIS", CHange wallpaper, change timezone, Add Additional Volume (1 gb) and make it available. Download and Install any software (putty/winscp/cloudberry explorer).... ==> Create a GOLDEN AMI, Launch instance from GoldenAMI and test you got all customisations or not.???

SOP : Standard Operational Procedure : 

DLM : Data Lifecycle manager : Automate the snapshot creation process. 
--> We use tags to filter the resources. 

Default Retention Values: 
Prod : 14 Days
Non Prod : 7 Days 

Fast snapshot restore : Enable fast snapshot restore to ensure that volumes created from snapshots created by this policy instantly deliver all of their provisioned performance.

--> Snapshots are point-in-time copies.
--> Snapshots stores in S3 platform (Not in your s3).
--> Can we view what data we have inside snapshots..?? NO
--> Snapshot Works with Incremental backup mechanism. 
--> If our volume is Encrypted, Snapshot also Encrypts automaticALLY. 
--> When we are launching a volume from encrypted snapshot, volume also encrypts automatically.
--> We cannot share an Default Master key Encrypted snapshot.
--> If we are using Custom encryption key, we can share snapshot with another aws account, but we need to provide permissions on encryption key also to another aws account.

Ec2 Instance isolation : 

Tenancy in AWS : 
--> Shared Tenancy : Underlying hardware/resources will be shared with multiple AWS customers. 
--> Dedicated Tenancy : Underlying hardware/resources will dedicatedly available to only one AWS customer. It won't share with any other.
	--> Dedicated Instance : 
	--> Dedicated Host : Host supports to launch multiple instances. Some applications required physical resources inforamtion to apply the licenses. 
__

EIP : Elastic IP Address : Dedicated IP address we will get from AWS. We can associate this to an ec2 instance. When Instance is STOP/START, this IP won't change.
(COST US : NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY, EVEN if you generated kept it idle)

*If we restart the Instance, IP Address won't change (Normal/EIP)
__

ENI : Elastic Network Interface : NIC CARD for Instance.. : 
--> EC2 instance and ENI should be in same AZ.


http://localhost/ or http://127.0.0.1/

** Security Groups : http / https traffic.. 
--> CHanges to the Security group takes effect immedeately. (No need to stop/start the instance). 
--> Security group won't support DENY. It allow the traffic. 
--> Security groups are stateful. We need to take care about INBOUND RULES only. 
--> All the Outbound traffic is allowed for every security groups. 

___

Whenever we launch an ec2 instance, 2 status checks will happen. 
-> System Status check : H/w is healtlhy or not at Physical resource level. (STOP/START)
-> Instane status check : OS level issues.
___

EBS VOlumes : Always use EBS volumes only.
Instance store volumes : We really don't use this in real environments.   (NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILTY)
	--> Also called as Ephemeral storages (Temporary storage).
	--> We cannot STOP/Start the instance.
	--> Storage will be delivered from underlying host/physical resources.
	--> If required, we can reboot. We don't loss any data.
	--> If underlying h/w failure happens, we'll loss all the data.
